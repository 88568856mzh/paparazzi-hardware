This is a daughterboard for the STM32F4 Discovery.

One of the ideas for this pcb was to build a sub 50â‚¬ autopilot, so everything is minimized.
Only THT components have been used, this should allow everbody to solder it himself.

The basic function is to break out all bus, adc and pwm pins to a useable pinout.
Each bus (UART, I2C, SPI) has a 5V and GND pin beneath.

The pcb was entirely designed in KiCad Version: (2013-07-07 BZR 4022)-stable

This version (V1.0) should be used with care !
