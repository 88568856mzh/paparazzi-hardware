This is a 3D printed new damper to replace the rubber parts that are
originally installed in the Parrot Bebop2. These rubber dampers are too soft
and might cause oscillations with the papareazzi autopilot. I had good
results results printing them in PETG, but PLA might also work. The softer
dampers will give better results for operating the camera.

The wider opening of the damper goes into the metal body of the Bebop2, the
shallow goes to the plastic cross and is secured with the washer.

There is a damper-tool that can be used to fasten the metal screw.
